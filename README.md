  * FOCUS ON PHARMACOLOGY, 2/e focused “teach-and-test” approach to learning pharmacology is designed specifically for allied health students. Early chapters lay the groundwork by introducing pharmacology’s history, legal and ethical principles, drug administration techniques, essential math, and calculations. Following chapters focus on drugs specific to body systems, and each body system chapter concisely reviewing anatomy and physiology, providing a foundation for understanding drug actions and uses. Pediatric and geriatric pharmacotherapies are then covered in detail, as are antibiotics and other drug categories. Updated throughout, this edition contains new chapters on medication errors and prevention, substance abuse, and drugs used to treat pregnant patients; as well as additional coverage of federal laws and herbal supplements. Full-color photos, figures, and tables make this text exceptionally engaging and useful.
